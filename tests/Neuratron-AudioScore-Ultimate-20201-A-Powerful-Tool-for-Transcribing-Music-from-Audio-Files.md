How to Use AudioScore Ultimate 2020.1
 
AudioScore Ultimate 2020.1 is easy to use and has a user-friendly interface. Here are some steps to help you get started with transcribing music from audio files:

1. Run AudioScore and click the Open music button on its toolbar. Then browse to the location of the track/file on your CD/hard disk and click Open.
2. AudioScore will use HitânâMix Ripper to analyze the music and find its notes. Once finished, AudioScore displays the notes as colored lines. Higher-pitched notes are displayed above lower ones, and later notes to the right of earlier ones.
3. Listen to a MIDI performance of the notes that AudioScore has found by pressing Space. Compare this with the original audio by pressing P or clicking on the Play button at the top left-hand side of the window.
4. If too many or too few notes have been found, click on the slider on the top right-hand side of the window to adjust AudioScoreâs note sensitivity.
5. Tell AudioScore the time signature by clicking on the Set Time Signature button above the Play button.
6. AudioScore automatically calculates the positions of barlines. If they are incorrect, starting from the first one after the track start and going forward, click & drag each one to the desired position.
7. Instruments that AudioScore has identified in the music are shown in different colors in the Instruments Pane in the bottom right-hand side of the window. If an instrument name is grayed out, it means AudioScore thought it wasnât present in the music.
8. Work from the track beginning, checking which instrument performs each note and whether there are any notes that should be split or joined together. You can use the tools on the toolbar to edit, delete, or add notes, as well as change their pitch, volume, or duration.
9. When you are satisfied with the transcription, you can export it as a MusicXML or MIDI file for use in other music programs, or print it out as a score. You can also save it as an AudioScore file for future editing.
